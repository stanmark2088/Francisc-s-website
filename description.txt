Using Bootstrap 4 CSS Framework, create a website that has the following features:


- All pages have a navigation bar with the menu that contains:
    - Home
    - Products
    - Our stores


- Home page is the route on "/"
    - Displays the menu on the upper side
    - Then, has a list of paragraphs with Lorem Ipsum text (4,5 paragraphs or how many it takes to fill the page to bottom


- Products page is the route on "/products"
    - On this route, it also displays the top menu bar
    - In a table, it displays some products, that are read from the products.csv file
    - On each product name, there's a href, that, when clicked, takes the user to the product/<id> page


- Product page is the route on "/products/<id>"
    - loads the product, from the file, based on the id
    - The page has a form
        - The form has a input field for quantity and a button
        - The button is named "order now"
        - When the button is pressed, you append to the file "orders.csv"
            - in the following format:
                - product_id,quantity,total_price


- There's also another route, "/admin", which is not displayed in the upper menu
    - When the user goes to "/admin" - it displays the orders from the orders.csv, within a table.
